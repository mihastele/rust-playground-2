---

## üìÖ Week 3: Advanced Patterns

### Day 15-17: Functional Programming

**Key Concepts**: Closures, iterators, functional patterns

### Day 18-19: Smart Pointers
- [ ] Understand `src/smart_pointers.rs`
- [ ] Learn when to use Box, Rc, RefCell
- [ ] **Exercise**: Implement a tree structure with Rc and RefCell

**Key Concepts**: Box, Rc, RefCell, Arc, interior mutability

### Day 20-21: Review and Practice
- [ ] Review all concepts from weeks 1-3
- [ ] Run all tests: `cargo test`
- [ ] **Project**: Build a small application combining concepts

**Week 3 Checkpoint**: Comfortable with most Rust patterns?

---

## üìÖ Week 4: Concurrency & Advanced

### Day 22-24: Concurrent Programming
- [ ] Study `src/concurrency.rs`
- [ ] Spawn threads and use channels

- [ ] Understand unsafe Rust
- [ ] Learn about macros
- [ ] **Exercise**: Write a simple declarative macro

**Key Concepts**: Unsafe, FFI, macros, advanced traits

### Day 27-28: Final Project
- [ ] Plan a project using multiple concepts
- [ ] Implement it from scratch
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Document your code

**Week 4 Checkpoint**: You're now a Rustacean! ü¶Ä

---

## üìö Daily Learning Routine

### Morning (30-60 minutes)
1. Read through one section of a module
2. Run the examples
3. Take notes on key concepts

### Afternoon (30-60 minutes)
1. Modify examples to experiment
2. Try to break things intentionally
3. Read compiler error messages

### Evening (30-60 minutes)
1. Complete the daily exercise
2. Write your own code using concepts
3. Review what you learned

## üéì Learning Tips

### Do's ‚úÖ
- **Read error messages carefully** - They're teaching you
- **Experiment actively** - Break things and fix them
- **Write tests** - They help you understand
- **Take breaks** - Let concepts sink in
- **Ask questions** - Use forums and Discord
- **Review regularly** - Repetition builds mastery

### Don'ts ‚ùå
- **Don't rush** - Rust has a learning curve
- **Don't skip ownership** - It's fundamental
- **Don't fight the compiler** - Work with it
- **Don't memorize** - Understand instead
- **Don't give up** - Everyone struggles at first

## üìñ Supplementary Resources

### When Stuck on Ownership
- Re-read `src/ownership.rs`
- Draw diagrams of ownership transfers
- Practice with simple examples first

### When Stuck on Traits
- Think of traits as interfaces
- Start with simple trait implementations
- Use trait bounds gradually

### When Stuck on Lifetimes
- Remember: lifetimes are about relationships
- Compiler usually infers them
- Explicit annotations are rare in practice

### When Stuck on Anything
1. Read the error message completely
2. Check the documentation
3. Search for the error online
4. Ask in Rust forums/Discord
5. Take a break and come back fresh

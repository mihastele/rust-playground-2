## üìö Learning Paths

### Path 1: Complete Beginner (Recommended)
1. **Read** `README.md` for overview
2. **Follow** `LEARNING_ROADMAP.md` (4-week plan)
3. **Start** with `src/basics.rs`
4. **Run** `cargo run` after each module
5. **Experiment** by modifying examples
6. **Test** your understanding with exercises

### Path 2: Quick Learner
1. **Skim** `README.md`
2. **Jump** to modules that interest you
3. **Run** `cargo run` to see examples
4. **Reference** `CHEATSHEET.md` as needed

### Path 3: Reference User
1. **Use** `CHEATSHEET.md` for syntax
2. **Browse** modules for specific topics
3. **Copy** patterns for your projects

## üéì First Steps

### Day 1: Hello, Rust!
```bash
# 1. Run the project
cargo run

# 2. Open src/basics.rs in your editor

# 3. Read through the comments

# 4. Modify some values and re-run
cargo run
```

### Day 2: Experiment
```bash
# 1. Open src/basics.rs

# 2. Try changing this:
let x = 5;

let x = 10;

# 3. Run again
cargo run

# 4. Try uncommenting error examples to see compiler messages
```

### Day 3: Test Your Knowledge
```bash
# 1. Run tests
cargo test

# 2. Read test code in each module

# 3. Write your own test
# Add to src/basics.rs:
#[test]
fn my_test() {
    assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
}

# 4. Run your test
cargo test my_test
```

**Total Learning Time:** 25-35 hours

## üõ†Ô∏è Editor Setup

### VS Code (Recommended)
1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install "rust-analyzer" extension
3. Install "CodeLLDB" extension (for debugging)
4. Open the `happyR` folder

### Other Editors
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Install Rust plugin
- **Vim/Neovim**: Install rust.vim + coc-rust-analyzer
- **Emacs**: Install rust-mode + lsp-mode

## üéØ Learning Tips

### Do This ‚úÖ
```rust
// 1. Read comments carefully
// Ownership rule: Each value has a single owner
let s = String::from("hello");

// 2. Experiment with code
let mut s = String::from("hello");
s.push_str(" world");
println!("{}", s);

// 3. Run often
// After each change, run: cargo run
```

### Avoid This ‚ùå
```rust
// 1. Don't skip ownership (Module 2)
// It's fundamental to everything else!

// 2. Don't just read - type the code yourself

// 3. Don't ignore compiler errors
// They're teaching you!
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "cargo: command not found"
```bash
# Add Rust to PATH (restart terminal after)
# Windows: Already done by installer
# macOS/Linux: source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

### "error: could not compile"
```bash
# Read the error message carefully
# It usually tells you exactly what's wrong

# Check which file has the error
# Fix the syntax
# Run again: cargo run
```

### "test failed"
```bash
# This is normal when learning!
# Read the test output
# Understand what's expected
# Fix your code
```

## üìö Resources at Your Fingertips

| File | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `README.md` | Overview & guide | Start here |
| `LEARNING_ROADMAP.md` | 4-week plan | Follow for structure |

## üéÆ Interactive Learning

### Exercise 1: Modify and Run
```bash
# 1. Open src/basics.rs
# 2. Find the variables_and_mutability() function
# 3. Change some values
# 4. Run: cargo run
# 5. See your changes in action!
```

### Exercise 2: Break and Fix
```bash
# 1. Open src/ownership.rs
# 2. Uncomment an error example
# 3. Run: cargo run
# 4. Read the compiler error
# 5. Understand why it's wrong
# 6. Fix it!
```

### Exercise 3: Write Your Own
```bash
# 1. Open src/basics.rs
# 2. Add a new function at the bottom:
pub fn my_experiment() {
    println!("My first Rust code!");
    let x = 42;
    println!("The answer is {}", x);
}

# 3. Call it from run_all_examples()
# 4. Run: cargo run
```

## üèÜ Your First Goal

**Complete Module 1 (Basics) in your first session!**

1. ‚úÖ Read through `src/basics.rs`
2. ‚úÖ Run `cargo run` and see output
3. ‚úÖ Modify at least 3 examples
4. ‚úÖ Run `cargo test basics`
5. ‚úÖ Understand variables, types, and control flow

**Time needed:** 2-3 hours

## üéâ Next Steps

After completing the basics:

1. **Module 2 (Ownership)** - The most important concept
2. **Module 3 (Structures)** - Build custom types
3. **Continue** through remaining modules
4. **Build** a small project
5. **Share** your learning journey!

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Take breaks** - Rust has a learning curve
2. **Type code yourself** - Don't just read
3. **Experiment freely** - Breaking things teaches you
4. **Read errors** - They're helpful, not scary
5. **Ask questions** - Community is friendly!

## üÜò Getting Help

- **Compiler errors**: Read them carefully, they explain the problem
- **Concepts unclear**: Re-read the module comments
- **Still stuck**: Check [Rust Users Forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/)
- **Quick questions**: [Rust Discord](https://discord.gg/rust-lang)

## üéä You're Ready!

You now have everything you need to start learning Rust. The journey begins with a single command:

```bash
cargo run
```

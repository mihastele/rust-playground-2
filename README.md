## üìö Learning Path

### Module 1: Rust Basics üéì
**File**: `src/basics.rs`

Learn the fundamentals:
- Variables and mutability (`let`, `mut`, shadowing)
- Data types (integers, floats, booleans, characters)
- Compound types (tuples, arrays)
- Functions and return values
- Control flow (`if`, `loop`, `while`, `for`, `match`)
- Comments and documentation
- String basics (`&str` vs `String`)
- Type conversion and casting

**Key Takeaway**: Rust is immutable by default, strongly typed, and expression-based.

---

### Module 2: Ownership & Borrowing üîê
**File**: `src/ownership.rs`

Master Rust's most unique feature:
- The three ownership rules
- Move semantics vs Copy types
- References and borrowing (`&` and `&mut`)
- Mutable vs immutable references
- Dangling reference prevention
- String slices and array slices
- Lifetimes and lifetime annotations
- Lifetime elision rules
- Static lifetime

**Key Takeaway**: Ownership ensures memory safety without garbage collection.

---

### Module 3: Structures & Enums üèóÔ∏è
**File**: `src/structures.rs`

Build custom data types:
- Classic structs with named fields
- Tuple structs
- Unit structs
- Methods and associated functions (`impl` blocks)
- Enums and variants
- Pattern matching with `match`
- `if let` and `while let` syntax
- The `Option<T>` enum (Rust's "no null" approach)
- Advanced pattern matching techniques

**Key Takeaway**: Rust's type system helps you model your domain precisely.

---

### Module 4: Traits & Generics üé≠
**File**: `src/traits_generics.rs`

Abstract and reuse code:
- Generic functions and types
- Trait definitions and implementations
- Trait bounds and where clauses
- Default implementations
- Returning traits (`impl Trait`)
- Conditional implementations
- Standard library traits (Clone, Copy, Debug, etc.)
- Operator overloading
- Associated types
- Supertraits
- Newtype pattern

**Key Takeaway**: Traits enable polymorphism without inheritance.

---

### Module 5: Collections üì¶
**File**: `src/collections.rs`

Work with dynamic data:
- Vectors (`Vec<T>`) - growable arrays
- Strings (`String`) - UTF-8 text
- Hash Maps (`HashMap<K, V>`) - key-value storage
- Hash Sets (`HashSet<T>`) - unique values
- VecDeque - double-ended queue
- BTreeMap - sorted map
- Collection operations (push, pop, insert, remove, extend)
- Iteration patterns
- Ownership with collections

**Key Takeaway**: Rust's collections are powerful, safe, and efficient.

---

### Module 6: Error Handling ‚ö†Ô∏è
**File**: `src/error_handling.rs`

Handle failures gracefully:
- `panic!` for unrecoverable errors
- `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors
- `Option<T>` for optional values
- `unwrap()`, `expect()`, and safe alternatives
- Error propagation with `?` operator
- Custom error types
- Combining different error types
- Result methods and combinators
- When to panic vs return Result

**Key Takeaway**: Rust forces you to handle errors explicitly.

---

### Module 7: Functional Programming üîÑ
**File**: `src/functional.rs`

Write expressive, functional code:
- Closures (anonymous functions)
- Closure capturing (by reference, by mutable reference, by value)
- Closure traits (`Fn`, `FnMut`, `FnOnce`)
- Iterators and lazy evaluation
- Iterator adaptors (`map`, `filter`, `take`, `skip`, `zip`)
- Consuming adaptors (`collect`, `sum`, `fold`, `any`, `all`)
- Custom iterators
- Functional patterns
- Zero-cost abstractions

**Key Takeaway**: Iterators are as fast as loops but more expressive.

---

### Module 8: Smart Pointers üß†
**File**: `src/smart_pointers.rs`

Manage memory intelligently:
- `Box<T>` - heap allocation
- `Deref` trait - smart pointer behavior
- `Drop` trait - custom cleanup
- `Rc<T>` - reference counting (single-threaded)
- `RefCell<T>` - interior mutability
- Combining `Rc<T>` and `RefCell<T>`
- Reference cycles and memory leaks
- `Weak<T>` - breaking cycles
- Practical use cases (trait objects, shared state, mocks)

**Key Takeaway**: Smart pointers provide flexible memory management patterns.

---

### Module 9: Concurrency ‚ö°
**File**: `src/concurrency.rs`

Write safe concurrent code:
- Thread creation and joining
- Move closures with threads
- Message passing with channels (`mpsc`)
- Multiple producers, single consumer
- Shared state with `Mutex<T>`
- `Arc<T>` - atomic reference counting (multi-threaded)
- `Send` and `Sync` traits
- Thread safety guarantees
- Deadlock prevention
- Parallel computation patterns
- Worker pools and practical patterns

**Key Takeaway**: Rust prevents data races at compile time.

---

### Module 10: Advanced Features üöÄ
**File**: `src/advanced.rs`

Explore advanced Rust:
- Unsafe Rust (raw pointers, unsafe functions)
- Foreign Function Interface (FFI)
- Static variables
- Unsafe traits
- Advanced trait features
- Type aliases
- Never type (`!`)
- Dynamically sized types (DST)
- Function pointers
- Declarative macros (`macro_rules!`)
- Attributes and conditional compilation
- Advanced patterns
- Best practices

**Key Takeaway**: Unsafe Rust gives you low-level control when needed.
